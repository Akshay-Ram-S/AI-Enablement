      "expected": "Presidio's PTO carryover policy aligns with common U.S. industry practices by allowing limited carryover, while globally PTO policies vary by country and regulation.",
      "output": "Now, let's compare Presidio's PTO carryover policy to industry standards in the U.S. and globally:\n\nPresidio's PTO Carryover Policy:\nPresidio allows employees to carry over up to 10 days of unused PTO to the following calendar year. Any balance exceeding 10 days is forfeited unless pre-approved by HR.\n\nIndustry Standards:\n\n1. United States:\n   - There are no national rules governing PTO carryover in the U.S.\n   - Policies vary among employers:\n     a) Some implement \"use-it-or-lose-it\" policies (no carryover)\n     b) Others allow employees to roll over unused PTO\n\n2. Global:\n   - PTO rollover policies vary globally, but many companies do allow some form of carryover.\n   - Carryover rules often specify whether unused PTO can be carried over to the next year and if there are limits on how much can be carried.\n\nComparison:\n\n1. Presidio's policy of allowing carryover is in line with many companies that offer PTO rollover, both in the U.S. and globally.\n\n2. The 10-day limit on carryover at Presidio is a common approach. Many companies that allow carryover set limits to prevent excessive accumulation of PTO.\n\n3. Presidio's policy is more generous than \"use-it-or-lose-it\" policies, which are used by some U.S. companies.\n\n4. The option for HR pre-approval to carry over more than 10 days provides some flexibility, which is not mentioned as a common feature in the industry standards information we found.\n\n5. Presidio's policy aligns with the global trend of specifying limits on how much PTO can be carried over.\n\nIn conclusion, Presidio's PTO carryover policy appears to be competitive and in line with common practices both in the U.S. and globally. It offers a balance between allowing employees to retain some unused PTO while also setting reasonable limits to manage accrual. The policy is more generous than stricter \"use-it-or-lose-it\" approaches but still maintains controls on excessive accumulation, which is a common concern for many companies.",

      "output": "I apologize, but after searching our internal HR policy documents, I couldn't find specific information on how Presidio employees can report discrimination. This information is not found in the policy documents that I have access to.\n\nTo summarize what we know:\n\n1. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Policy: \n   Presidio has a clear commitment to fair and equitable hiring practices. The company does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other protected characteristic under applicable law.\n\n2. Reporting Discrimination:\n   Unfortunately, the specific process for reporting discrimination is not detailed in the policy documents I have access to.\n\nGiven this lack of information, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Contact HR: Reach out to Presidio's Human Resources department directly. They should be able to provide you with the correct procedure for reporting discrimination.\n\n2. Speak with a Supervisor: If you're comfortable doing so, you might discuss the issue with your immediate supervisor or manager.\n\n3. Check the Employee Handbook: If you have access to a complete employee handbook, it might contain more detailed information about reporting procedures that are not captured in the policy documents I searched.\n\n4. Look for an Ethics Hotline: Many companies have confidential ethics hotlines or online reporting systems. Check if Presidio has such a system in place.\n\nIf you need more specific information about reporting discrimination at Presidio, I recommend contacting the HR department directly. They will have the most up-to-date and accurate information on the company's reporting procedures.",
